# No more 'Beijing bikini': Chinese city calls **topless** men 'uncivilized'

Each summer, as Chinese cities **swelter** under the baking heat, middle-aged men across the country roll their T-shirts up above their T-shirts up above their bellies to cool down. It's a style so **ubiquitous** that it's even earned a **fond** nickname: the "Beijing bikini."

But in a city in China's eastern Shandong province, Beijing bikini lovers - and those who **forgo** tops altogether - have **fallen out of favor** with the local authorities.

On Tuesday, authorities in Jinan - a city of 8.7 million - issued a notice ordering the public to keep their shirts on in public places. It came as temperatures rose to a sweltering 36C(96F) this week.

Jinan authorities aim to **rectify** such "uncivilized behavior," according to the notice, which added that citizens had complained about the "uncivilized phenomenon" which damaged the image of the city.

Authorities said they planned to **crack down on** "improper dressing in public places," which included "shirtlessness" and "**wanton** exposure of body parts." Public **bickering**, **jumping queues**, littering, and "uncivilized dog walking" are also being targeted under the notice, which is aimed at enhancing the image of the city.

But on social media, many people thought the regulations were **overkill**. "Being shirtless cuts more **carbon** emissions than turning on **AC**," one commenter said, while another added "Let the old people be free."
